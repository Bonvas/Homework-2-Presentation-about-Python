                                       CORE SYNTAX CONCEPTS



      Python is a language for communicating with a computer. Like any language, Python has rules for constructing “sentences” so that the interpreter program can understand the commands and execute them. These rules are called syntax.


    Key Principles:

- Indentation (Structural Indentation) - Defines code blocks instead of using {}.
- Comments - Explain the code and are ignored by the interpreter ( # , “””…”””).
- Variables & Data Types - The type of a variable is determined automatically (name = “Ihor”)
- Conditional Statements - Allow executing code based on conditions (if , elif , else).
- Loops - Execute code blocks repeatedly (for , while).
- Functions - Organize code into reusable blocks  (def greet(name): ). 
- Data Collections: 
    list - ordered, mutable collection; 
    tuple - ordered, immutable collection; 
    set- unordered collection of unique elements; 
    dict - dictionary storing key-value pairs.

   Modularity & Imports - Allows importing ready-made libraries to extend functionality (import math).
