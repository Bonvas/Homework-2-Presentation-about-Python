Slide 7:
Ecosystem and popular libraries:
Python Ecosystem - the complete set of tools, libraries, frameworks, and resources that allow developers to efficiently solve a wide range of tasks.
Python is well-known for its rich ecosystem, which includes:
Scientific and Numerical Computing:
- NumPy - working with multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations.
- Pandas - data manipulation and analysis (tables, DataFrame).
- SciPy - scientific and engineering computations, statistics, integrals.
Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib - basic plots and charts.
- Seaborn - enhanced visualization with attractive design.
- Plotly - interactive graphs and dashboards.
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:
- Scikit-learn - classical machine learning algorithms.
- TensorFlow/Keras - deep learning and neural networks.
- PyTorch - another popular framework for neural networks.
Web Development:
- Django - full-featured web framework.
- Flask - lightweight microframework for web applications.
Automation and Utilities:
- Requests - working with HTTP requests.
- BeautifulSoup/Scrapy - web scraping and parsing.
- Open CV - image and video processing.
