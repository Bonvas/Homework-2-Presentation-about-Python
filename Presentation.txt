WHAT IS PYTHON

 

     DEFENITION         HISTORY         PHILOSOPHY


   Python is a high-level programming language creates by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
   It emphasizes simplicity, readability and flexibility, making it one of the most popular languages in the world.



   Python was developed as a successor to the ABC language. Van Rossum aimed to design a language that combined the power of C with the ease of use of scripting languages. Over the years, it has evolved through major versions - Python 2 and Python 3 - and now power web development< data science, AI and automation.


   The philosophy of Python is captured in "The Zen of Python" - a collection of guiding principles such as:
  - Beautiful is better than ugly;
  - Simple is better than complex;
  - Readability counts.

  These ideas promote writing clever, elegant< and maintainable code.






Slide #4

KEY ADVANTAGES

    Simplicity and Readability:  

  Python's syntax is clean and straightforward, resembling the English language, which drastically reduces "syntactical noise" and makes the code easy to understand and maintain.


    Large Standard Library ("Batteries Included"): 

  It comes with a vast collection of modules and packages, meaning you don't have to write code for common tasks from scratch


 Active Community and Ecosystem:

  A huge, helpful global community provides extensive support, documentation, tutorials, and a massive collection of third-party libraries (Ecosystem).


  Versatility: 

  Can be used across various domains: web development, data science, machine learning, scripting, and scientific computing.





Slide #5

                                       CORE SYNTAX CONCEPTS



      Python is a language for communicating with a computer. Like any language, Python has rules for constructing “sentences” so that the interpreter program can understand the commands and execute them. These rules are called syntax.


    Key Principles:

- Indentation (Structural Indentation) - Defines code blocks instead of using {}.
- Comments - Explain the code and are ignored by the interpreter ( # , “””…”””).
- Variables & Data Types - The type of a variable is determined automatically (name = “Ihor”)
- Conditional Statements - Allow executing code based on conditions (if , elif , else).
- Loops - Execute code blocks repeatedly (for , while).
- Functions - Organize code into reusable blocks  (def greet(name): ). 
- Data Collections: 
    list - ordered, mutable collection; 
    tuple - ordered, immutable collection; 
    set- unordered collection of unique elements; 
    dict - dictionary storing key-value pairs.

   Modularity & Imports - Allows importing ready-made libraries to extend functionality (import math).






Slide 7:
Ecosystem and popular libraries:
Python Ecosystem - the complete set of tools, libraries, frameworks, and resources that allow developers to efficiently solve a wide range of tasks.
Python is well-known for its rich ecosystem, which includes:
Scientific and Numerical Computing:
- NumPy - working with multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations.
- Pandas - data manipulation and analysis (tables, DataFrame).
- SciPy - scientific and engineering computations, statistics, integrals.
Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib - basic plots and charts.
- Seaborn - enhanced visualization with attractive design.
- Plotly - interactive graphs and dashboards.
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:
- Scikit-learn - classical machine learning algorithms.
- TensorFlow/Keras - deep learning and neural networks.
- PyTorch - another popular framework for neural networks.
Web Development:
- Django - full-featured web framework.
- Flask - lightweight microframework for web applications.
Automation and Utilities:
- Requests - working with HTTP requests.
- BeautifulSoup/Scrapy - web scraping and parsing.
- Open CV - image and video processing.

Slide 8:
Languages comparison:
