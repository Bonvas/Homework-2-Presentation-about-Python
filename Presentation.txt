WHAT IS PYTHON

 

     DEFENITION         HISTORY         PHILOSOPHY


   Python is a high-level programming language creates by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
   It emphasizes simplicity, readability and flexibility, making it one of the most popular languages in the world.



   Python was developed as a successor to the ABC language. Van Rossum aimed to design a language that combined the power of C with the ease of use of scripting languages. Over the years, it has evolved through major versions - Python 2 and Python 3 - and now power web development< data science, AI and automation.


   The philosophy of Python is captured in "The Zen of Python" - a collection of guiding principles such as:
  - Beautiful is better than ugly;
  - Simple is better than complex;
  - Readability counts.

  These ideas promote writing clever, elegant< and maintainable code.






Slide 7:
Ecosystem and popular libraries:
Python Ecosystem - the complete set of tools, libraries, frameworks, and resources that allow developers to efficiently solve a wide range of tasks.
Python is well-known for its rich ecosystem, which includes:
Scientific and Numerical Computing:
- NumPy - working with multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations.
- Pandas - data manipulation and analysis (tables, DataFrame).
- SciPy - scientific and engineering computations, statistics, integrals.
Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib - basic plots and charts.
- Seaborn - enhanced visualization with attractive design.
- Plotly - interactive graphs and dashboards.
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:
- Scikit-learn - classical machine learning algorithms.
- TensorFlow/Keras - deep learning and neural networks.
- PyTorch - another popular framework for neural networks.
Web Development:
- Django - full-featured web framework.
- Flask - lightweight microframework for web applications.
Automation and Utilities:
- Requests - working with HTTP requests.
- BeautifulSoup/Scrapy - web scraping and parsing.
- Open CV - image and video processing.

Slide 8:
Languages comparison:
Main Focus:
Python: Quick development, Data Science, Web Development.
Jave: Enterprise Systems, Mobile (Android).
C++: System Progrannimg, Games, High Performance.
JavaScript: Web Development (Frontend, Backend), Interactivity.
Sintax:
Python: Simple, readable, uses indentation.
Java: Verbose, requires semicolons and curly braces.
C++: Complex, powerful, requires manual memory management.
JavaScript: Similar to C-style languages.
Performance: 
Python: Slower (Interpreted).
Java: Fast (Compiled to bytecode), High Performance.
C++: Fastest (Compiled to machine code).
JavaScript: Fast (due to JIT compilation).
Typing: 
Python: Dynamic (Data type determined at runtime).
Java: Static (Data type determined at compile time).
C++: Static.
JavaScript: Dynamic.
Ecosystem:
Python: Vast number of libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask).
Java: Mature, large ecosystem (Spring, Maven).
C++: Many low-level lebraries.
JavaScript: Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js, Node).
